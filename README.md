# 🛍️ Price Comparison Backend API

This is the backend service for a **mobile price comparison app**, built using **Python** (FastAPI/Flask) and **PostgreSQL**.

It exposes API endpoints that allow users to search and compare product prices across multiple platforms (using mock data, due to limited access to real APIs).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend Language:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy or raw queries
- **Environment Variables:** managed via `.env` file

## 🚀 Features
- Product listing and search
- Price comparison logic
- Platform filtering
- Secure and scalable API structure

## 🧪 Limitations
Due to a lack of open APIs from major e-commerce platforms, this backend uses **mock data** to simulate product listings.
